<h1 style="text-align:centre;font-family:Algerian;">HAPPY WOMEN'S DAY</h1>
<p style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva;font-size:160%;">
International Women’s Day is an annual event that celebrates the amazing achievements of women throughout history.<br>
 It’s a day dedicated to highlighting the myriad ways that women have influenced, and continue to influence, society and the world at large.<br>

As well as celebrating the contributions of incredible women, International Women’s Day is also a day to highlight and raise awareness of inequalities and other issues that women still face today.<br>
 Historically, women have been variously denied their right to vote, work, seek an education and have financial independence, among many other basic human rights.<br>
 Because of the brilliant women who fought against these injustices, women today have far more say in the world now than they have in the past.<br> 
There are, however, still challenges that women face every day. Gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women are still pertinent issues. <br>
International Women’s Day is a chance to fight for these challenges to be addressed.</p>
